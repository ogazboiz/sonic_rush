# üöÄ SonicRush - Activity-Based Streaming Protocol

**Real-time Money Streaming + Activity-Based Rewards on Sonic Blockchain**

*Built for Sonic S Tier Hackathon - August 1st to September 1st, 2025*

---

## üèÜ Hackathon Alignment

### Sonic S Tier Hackathon Goals
This project directly addresses the hackathon's core objectives:

‚úÖ **Leverages Sonic's Speed**: Utilizes Sonic's high-performance blockchain for real-time streaming calculations  
‚úÖ **Innovative DeFi Solution**: Combines streaming payments with sustainable yield farming  
‚úÖ **Builder-Friendly**: Clean, well-documented code with comprehensive testing  
‚úÖ **Real-World Application**: Solves actual problems in payroll, subscriptions, and DeFi  
‚úÖ **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to handle high-frequency transactions on Sonic's fast network  

### Prize Track: Open Innovation
SonicRush represents a breakthrough in DeFi economics - the first protocol where rewards are directly tied to platform activity. No activity = no rewards, creating truly sustainable tokenomics powered by Sonic's lightning-fast infrastructure.

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

SonicRush is a revolutionary streaming protocol that pioneered **activity-based rewards**. Unlike traditional DeFi protocols that offer unsustainable yields, rewards are directly tied to platform usage - creating the first truly sustainable DeFi economics.

### Key Innovation: Activity-Based APY
- ‚ö° **No Activity = 0% APY** - No free money, no unsustainable yields
- üìà **Dynamic Scaling**: 1x to 10x reward multipliers based on streaming volume  
- üéØ **40% APY Cap** - Sustainable base rate with activity scaling
- üéÅ **Excess Bonus Distribution** - Extra profits shared: 50% owner, 30% charity, 20% stakers
- üîÑ **24-Hour Activity Window** - Fresh activity tracking prevents gaming
- üè¶ **Owner-Adjustable Parameters** - Adapt to market conditions

---

## üéØ Core Features

### üí∏ Real-Time Money Streaming
- **Create Streams**: Send money that flows continuously to recipients
- **Real-Time Withdrawal**: Recipients can withdraw at any second
- **Flexible Duration**: From minutes to years
- **Cancellation**: Both parties can cancel with automatic refunds

### üè¶ Activity-Based Vault System
- **Stake ETH**: Provide liquidity and earn activity-based rewards
- **No Activity = No Rewards**: 0% APY when platform has no streams
- **Dynamic APY**: Up to 40% APY base rate with activity-based scaling
- **Excess Bonus System**: When platform generates excess profits:
  - 50% ‚Üí Owner revenue
  - 30% ‚Üí Charity donations
  - 20% ‚Üí Extra staker bonus rewards
- **Real Revenue**: All rewards funded by 0.1% streaming fees
- **Flexible Parameters**: Owner can adjust APY caps and revenue splits

### üõ°Ô∏è Security & Reliability
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 20+ test cases covering all scenarios
- **Reentrancy Protection**: Built-in security measures
- **Access Control**: Owner-only functions for governance
- **Emergency Controls**: Pause functionality for safety

## üîç How It Works

### 1. Money Streaming Process
```
User A                    TimeFlow Vault                    User B
   |                           |                             |
   |------ Create Stream ----->|                             |
   |     (10 ETH, 1 hour)      |                             |
   |                           |---- Collect Fee (0.01 ETH)--|
   |                           |---- Start Stream (9.99 ETH)-|
   |                           |                             |
   |                           |<---- Withdraw Request -----|
   |                           |---- Send Available Amount ->|
```

### 2. Vault Economics
```
Streaming Fees ‚Üí Rewards Pool ‚Üí Vault Stakers
     0.1%           100%           Based on stake
```

### 3. Real-Time Calculations
```solidity
// Amount streamed = time_elapsed * flow_rate
uint256 streamed = (block.timestamp - startTime) * flowRate;

// Claimable = streamed - already_withdrawn
uint256 claimable = streamed > withdrawn ? streamed - withdrawn : 0;
```
